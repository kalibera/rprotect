Description: Routines for solving systems of delay differential equations by
   interfacing numerical routines written by Simon N. Wood , with contributions
   by Benjamin J. Cairns. These numerical routines first appeared in Simon
   Wood's 'solv95' program. This package includes a vignette and a complete
   user's guide. 'PBSddesolve' originally appeared on CRAN under the name
   'ddesolve'. That version is no longer supported. The current name emphasizes
   a close association with other PBS packages, particularly 'PBSmodelling'.
