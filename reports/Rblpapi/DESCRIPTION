Description: An R Interface to 'Bloomberg' is provided via the 'Blp API'.
SystemRequirements: A valid Bloomberg installation. The API headers and
        dynamic library are downloaded from
        <https://github.com/Rblp/blp> during the build step. See
        <https://bloomberg.github.io/blpapi-docs/cpp/3.8> as well as
        <http://www.bloomberglabs.com/api/> for API documentation. A
        compiler recent enough for (at least partial) C++11 support;
        g++-4.6.* or later should be sufficient and g++-4.9.* or later
        is preferred.
