Description: Package for Bayesian Model Averaging in linear models and
    generalized linear models using stochastic or
    deterministic sampling without replacement from posterior
    distributions.  Prior distributions on coefficients are
    from Zellner's g-prior or mixtures of g-priors
    corresponding to the Zellner-Siow Cauchy Priors or the
    mixture of g-priors from Liang et al (2008)
    <DOI:10.1198/016214507000001337>
    for linear models or mixtures of g-priors in GLMs of Li and Clyde (2015)
    <http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06913>. Other model
    selection criteria include AIC, BIC and Empirical Bayes estimates of g.
    Sampling probabilities may be updated based on the sampled models
    using Sampling w/out Replacement or an efficient MCMC algorithm
    samples models using the BAS tree structure as an efficient hash table.
    Uniform priors over all models or beta-binomial prior distributions on
    model size are allowed, and for large p truncated priors on the model
    space may be used.  The user may force variables to always be included.
    Details behind the sampling algorithm are provided in
    Clyde, Ghosh and Littman (2010)   <DOI:10.1198/jcgs.2010.09049>.
