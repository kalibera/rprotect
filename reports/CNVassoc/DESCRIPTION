Description: Carries out analysis of common 
             Copy Number Variants (CNVs) and imputed Single Nucleotide 
             Polymorphisms (SNPs) in population-based studies. 
             It includes tools for estimating association under a series 
             of study designs (case-control, cohort, etc), using several 
             dependent variables (class status, censored data, counts) 
             as response, adjusting for covariates and considering 
             various inheritance models. Moreover, it is possible to 
             perform epistasis studies with pairs of CNVs or imputed SNPs.
             It has been optimized in order to make feasible the analyses 
             of Genome Wide Association studies (GWAs) with hundreds of 
             thousands of genetic variants (CNVs / imputed SNPs). Also, 
             it incorporates functions for inferring copy number (CNV 
             genotype calling). Various classes and methods for generic 
             functions (print, summary, plot, anova, ...) have been 
             created to facilitate the analysis.
