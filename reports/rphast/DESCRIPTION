Title: Interface to PHAST Software for Comparative Genomics
Author: Melissa Hubisz, Katherine Pollard, and Adam Siepel
Description: Provides an R interface to the PHAST software
    (Phylogenetic Analysis with Space/Time Models).  It can be used for
    many types of analysis in comparative and evolutionary genomics,
    such as estimating models of evolution from sequence data, scoring
    alignments for conservation or acceleration, and predicting
    elements based on conservation or custom phylogenetic hidden Markov
    models.  It can also perform many basic operations on multiple
    sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees.
