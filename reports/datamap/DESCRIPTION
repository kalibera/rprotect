Description: datamap utilizes variable bindings and objects of class
        "UserDefinedDatabase" to provide a simple mapping system to
        foreign objects. Maps can be used as environments or attached
        to the search path, and changes to either are persistent.
        Mapped foreign objects are fetched in real-time and are never
        cached by the mapping system.
