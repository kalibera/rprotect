Version: 0.4-6
Date: 2017-01-05
Author: Yixuan Qiu and authors/contributors of the
    included software. See file AUTHORS for details.
Maintainer: Yixuan Qiu <yixuan.qiu@cos.name>
Description: Making it easy to use various types of fonts ('TrueType',
    'OpenType', Type 1, web fonts, etc.) in R graphs, and supporting most output
    formats of R graphics including PNG, PDF and SVG. Text glyphs will be converted
    into polygons or raster images, hence after the plot has been created, it no
    longer relies on the font files. No external software such as 'Ghostscript' is
    needed to use this package.
