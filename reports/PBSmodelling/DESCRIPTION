Description: Provides software to facilitate the design, testing, and operation
   of computer models. It focuses particularly on tools that make it easy to
   construct and edit a customized graphical user interface (GUI). Although our
   simplified GUI language depends heavily on the R interface to the Tcl/Tk
   package, a user does not need to know Tcl/Tk. Examples illustrate models
   built with other R packages, including PBSmapping, PBSddesolve, and BRugs. 
   A complete user's guide `PBSmodelling-UG.pdf' shows how to use this package
   effectively.
