Description: The 'gRbase' package provides general features
    which are used by other graphical modelling packages, in particular
    by the packages 'gRain', 'gRim' and 'gRc'.
    'gRbase' contains several data sets relevant for use in connection with
    graphical models. Almost all data sets used in the book Graphical
    Models with R (2012) are contained in 'gRbase'.
    'gRbase' implements several graph algorithms (based mainly on
    representing graphs as adjacency matrices - either in the form
    of a standard matrix or a sparse matrix). Some graph
    algorithms are:
    (i) maximum cardinality search (for marked and unmarked graphs).
    (ii) moralize.
    (iii) triangulate.
    (iv) junction tree.
    'gRbase' facilitates array operations,
    'gRbase' implements functions for testing for conditional independence.
    'gRbase' illustrates how hierarchical log-linear models may be
    implemented and describes concept of graphical meta
    data. These features, however, are not maintained anymore and
    remains in 'gRbase' only because there exists a paper describing
    these facilities: A Common Platform for Graphical Models in R:
    The 'gRbase' Package, Journal of Statistical Software, Vol 14,
    No 17, 2005.
    NOTICE Proper functionality of 'gRbase' requires that the packages graph,
    'Rgraphviz' and 'RBGL' are installed from 'bioconductor'; for
    installation instructions please refer to the web page given below.
