Package: Daim
Title: Diagnostic accuracy of classification models.
Version: 1.1.0
Author: Sergej Potapov, Werner Adler, Benjamin Hofner and Berthold Lausen.
Description: Several functions for evaluating the accuracy of
        classification models. The package provides the following
        performance measures: repeated k-fold cross-validation, 
		0.632 and 0.632+ bootstrap estimation of the misclassification rate, 
        sensitivity, specificity and AUC. If an application is 
        computationally intensive, parallel execution can be used 
        to reduce the computational effort.
Depends: R (>= 2.15.1), parallel
Imports: rms
Suggests: MASS, rpart, ipred, e1071, randomForest, mboost, TH.data
