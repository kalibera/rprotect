Description: Heller-Heller-Gorfine ('HHG') tests are a set of powerful statistical
    tests of multivariate k-sample homogeneity and independence. For the univariate
    case, the package also offers implementations of the 'MinP DDP' and 'MinP ADP'
    tests, which are consistent against all continuous alternatives but are
    distribution-free, and are thus much faster to apply.
